#Service Composition

- A service composition combines services following a certain composition pattern to achieve a business goal,
solve a scientific problem, or provide new service functions in general (Curbera, Khalaf, Mukhi, Tai, &
Weerawarana, 2003)

- Service compositions may themselves become services, making composition a
recursive operation.

- During an online order process for example, a composition can exist of a service that
checks a customerâ€™s zip code as well as the delivery time of the goods ordered.
