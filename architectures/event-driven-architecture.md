## How is EDA different from SOA?

| SOA                                  | EDA                                   |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Applications composed at design-time | Applications are composed at run-time |
| Linear flow between services         | Asynchronous components               |
| Predictable behaviour                | Reactive behaviour                    |
| Request/Response is common, overused | Natural fit for distributed systems   |
